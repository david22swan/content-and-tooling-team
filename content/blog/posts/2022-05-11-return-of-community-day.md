We are excited to announce that community day is returning on May 16th 2022 and will be continuing every Monday for the forseable future.

## Why is community day so good anyway?

It means we get to spend time with our **amazing** community, understand how our content is being used and help level up our modules and tools by addressing issues and pull requests.

Community day benefits us as a team too!

* Promotes collaboration and healthy team work :hearts: 
* Upskills new *and* existing engineers :female-construction-worker: 
* Increases prodictivity :100: 
* Overall increase of team morale :+1:
